# iOS Flagship Automation
This project contains the tests for the iHeart Radio flagship iOS app. 

## Setup 
Run:

	./setup.sh
	
This executes commands to build gradle, download dependencies, and create an Eclipse project. 

####Note
You may need to remove the src/ folder from your build path from within Eclipse. If you are seeing a build error after cloning and runing setup, simply right click the src/ directory, highlight build path, and select remove from build path. This should remove all errors.
